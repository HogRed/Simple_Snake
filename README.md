## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat food, which increases your score and the length of the snake. Be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.

## Features

- **Real-Time Score Display**: The current score is displayed on the screen during gameplay.
- **Customizable Game Window**: Adjust the game window size and grid by modifying the constants in the code.
- **Simple Graphics**: Clean and straightforward visuals for a smooth gaming experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Ways the game could be improved
- **Start Menu and Game Over Screen**:
  - Implement a start menu where players can choose to start the game, view instructions, or exit. Enhance the game over screen with options to restart or quit.

- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - Allow players to select difficulty levels that adjust the snake's speed or the frequency of food spawning.

- **Obstacles and Levels**:
  - Add randomly placed obstacles on the grid that the snake must avoid.
  - Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty and unique layouts.

- **Sound Effects and Music**:
  - Incorporate background music during gameplay.
  - Add sound effects for actions like eating food or colliding.
